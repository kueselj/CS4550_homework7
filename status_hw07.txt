Web Dev Spring 2021 HW07 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
James Kuesel


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/kueselj/CS4550_homework7

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

events.jamiekuesel.com

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

Everything is working perfectly, and it looks great!

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

It is not properly deployed. I ran into what I believe to be mitigation issues and issues with the deploy script.

I feel oh so very very lost. I'd like to be able to start these assignments earlier to go to OH, but with a weekly timeline and other courses, its just unrealisitic. 

It's very discouraging getting an entire assignment done only for it to be curtailed at the last step.

6. If you would like the deployment for an old homework to be reconsidered, what
are the links to your Inkfish submission and deployed site?

I would like my hw4 submission to be reconsidered.

Inkfish: https://inkfish.ntuck-neu.site/subs/4988

Deployed Site: hw04.jamiekuesel.com

And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
 - Development
 - Deployment
 - Submission
