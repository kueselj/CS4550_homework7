# Events

I got everything working in this assignment, except, of course, the deploy.
It looks great, works great, but the deploy. I'm just not sure what to do anymore when I run into errors, I feel so very very lost.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
